This little java console app checks IMDB event pages against isitoninstant.com to see if there any winners from film festivals and competitions that are currently streaming on netflix. It outputs everything into a text file (in the user's home dir) tab-delimited so that it can be opened in excel.

It currently checks 2010-2014 winners and nominees from the following:
* Academy Awards
* Ann Arbor
* BAFTA
* Berlin
* Cannes
* Golden Globes
* Sundance
* Tokyo
* Toronto
* Tribeca
* Venice

It's quite easy to add/remove new awards/years but the code must be recompiled.

Some limitations and gochas:
* It doesn't check meta data or years to make sure that there isn't a different movie with the same name on netflix.
* It's single threaded (I didn't want to be rude to IMDB or isitstreaming) and has to make a bunch of requests so it's on the slower side.
