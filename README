This little java console app checks IMDB event pages against isitoninstant.com to see if any winners from film festivals and competitions that are currently streaming on netflix.

It currently checks 2010-2014 winners and nominees from the following:
* Academy Awards
* Ann Arbor
* BAFTA
* Berlin
* Cannes
* Golden Globes
* Sundance
* Tokya
* Toronto
* Tribeca
* Venice

It's quite easy to add/remove new awards/years but the code must be recompiled.

Some limitations and gochas:
* I didn't bother handling non-ascii characters
* I use GET requests on isitoninstant.com instead of POST requests, sometimes the site doesn't respond well (typically with those non-ascii characters.
* It doesn't check meta data or years to make sure that there isn't a movie with the same name on netflix.
